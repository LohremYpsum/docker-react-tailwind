## Using the Repo 
This is a Boilerplate Repo for React in Conjunction with TailwindCSS to get you started. 
It already contains a customized a Folderstructure, but feel free to modify it 
to your needs. 

## Prerequisites: 
you need to have Docker installed on your Machine. Get it here: 
 - [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) 
 - [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
 - [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)

## Using Docker 
The "docker-compose.yaml" contains the Docker-service Configuration for your app services (e.g. an api service, which runs parallel to your app service). React is already defined, but you can add as many additional services you need. 

Run "docker-compose up" to spin up your docker-container and visit your react-app on localhost:3000.
Inital Start-up might take some time, dependent on your machine. Be patient and have fun :)
